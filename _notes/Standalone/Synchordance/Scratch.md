- messed with the fossils when she was young and was touched by corruption > wild shape, went crazy and hurt ppl > exiled
Maodannez Ollivier (they)
- raised within Orthodoxy to become a cleric (Vigilance)

TODO
- Story
	- carmine plotting against elias. interactions with players?
	- whats going to happen with carmine, elias. faction war, aberrant mage, promotion?

- maodennez: question devotion to the church / force her to do horrible things / tempt her away from the church
- aymara: capture as an aberrance (experiment or kill) / tempt to attack church / acceptance in exchange for myra
	- paladin chasing an aberrant magician - aymara
- myra: repress or regulate / tempt with acceptance in exchange for humanity / tempt to attack church / sell out aymara in exchange for greater freedom
- alex: sell out friends / 



- need to plant Elias' stuff more. his motives
	- expose Carmine's plot, bring the orthodox hammer down
	- bring acquisitions into it? has he been colluding with them?
- carmine asks them to neutralize the fossil and give it to her?

- if you redo this - nix the sodium plotline. it's just that the fossil was stolen and they have to go to tarrasque
	- obviously if the players are missing the sodium theyre not going to approach the dangerous monster
