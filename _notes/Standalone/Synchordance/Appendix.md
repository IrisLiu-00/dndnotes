### The Ravage
- Wasteland of basalt canyons, ashy soil, black glass slicks
- Produced by some ancient cataclysm millennia ago
- Fossils of monsters preserved between layers of lava - haunted by the souls of dead beasts, volatile
### Synchordant Orthodoxy
- Synchord: divine power that is the source of all magic. All magic wielders derive their ability from this source.
- Conceptualizes the Synchord as a divinely-ordained order of nature, acting in opposition to corruption 
	- corruption manifests in the fossils. Subversion of reality
- Includes priests who study the Synchord, warriors who enforce order, as well as natural philosophers who study fossils + geology in an attempt to understand the Cataclysm and how to control its remnants 

Reconstruction
- Certain fossils can be harnessed for the beast's power, but others are deemed too dangerous and must be exorcised
- Exorcism is a synchordant ritual, combining two volatile elements to form a stable whole. The energy of the reaction exorcises and destroys the beast and its bones
	- holy water: hydrochloric acid, stored in magically stabilized iron flasks? or glass with iron inlays
		- runes to direct the reaction in a magic circle
	- arrange holy water in a pentagram, wires connecting, sodium placed at the stopper of the flasks
	- electric impluse on the wire > electrolysis of HCL produces chlorine gas (and hydrogen gas?!) > react with sodium in bright red flame
		- chlorine gas = pellets + hcl, or electrolysis of potassium chloride
	- place devices, then spellcasting to initiate (x spell attacks to succeed)? chain the beast in place?
		- minions harrass/steal the flasks
		- give them the chalk/iron filing diagram already drawn out - repurpose the reconstruction?
	- give players an exorcist's pack
- Reconstruction - resurrects the soul and ties it to the fossils. a shadow of the beast and its power
	- requires accurate anatomical knowledge of the beast
## Voltiss Railroad Company
- vampires? not tolerated by Orthodoxy
- Carmine Voltiss

# Characters

High Vigilance Elias Hall: Orthodox Vigilance (priest) working in Acquisitions(?)
- Human. Rugged, bearded, chipped tooth. Hat brim pulled low, clerical robes unbuttoned and jauntily flung over one shoulder. 
- VOICE: pompous + british. Musical laugh.
- Popular, charming, showman. Unconventional, did poorly in school. Usually a bit of an idiot but can be surprisingly sly. 
- Wants the orthodoxy (himself) to maintain power. Aberrant power in the right hands is justified. 
	- Enough of those doddering old fools with their books and their robes. They never understood ambition
	- Resents the power Voltiss is gaining, looking to discredit them and destroy the railroad. Thinks the Orthodoxy too set in its ways, unwilling to do what it takes to keep power - but also selling out to Voltiss. 
	- Inquests is no more than a puppet for the tech barons now
	- Power must be controlled, given to the right hands
- Wants to reconstruct the lindwyrm, destroy the railway and smear Voltiss
- Probably knows Carmine is out to get him, playing dumb. Might confide in players?
- Old schoolmate of Maodennez, always more popular in school. Competitor. 
- Studied fey beasts in seminary - banshees, dryads, kelpies
	- Commonly thought he only did this to get a supply of pixie dust (powdered fey fossils, hallucinogen party drug)
- STATS: essential npc templar

Carmine Voltiss: seventh gen from the Voltiss matriarch. Overseeing the railway project. 
- Dark hair cut in a bob, languid pale eyes. Fangs. Charcoal pantsuit with very peaked collars
- VOICE: Eastern European
- Snide, sardonic, languorous. Mathematical, analytical.
- Hostile towards Orthodoxy, resents their maintenance of power. Her family hemorrhages vast amounts of money for the Orthodoxy. She can hardly go anywhere without one of their lackeys on her tail. Has to drink pig blood.
- Smuggling out any fossils she can get ahold of - mostly nixies
	- Trying to find a power that can improve engine power, would really like a red dragon. Synchordant runes are too limited. 
	- Paying workers to take them to Tarrasque with the slag
	- Carmine found the egg shell (cocoon) early and thought there might be a dragon in the tunnel
	- Has been sending Elias out on odd jobs to keep him out of the way, hopefully get killed by bandits
	- But also always has Elias front of the pack when she senses there might be a fossil (strigoi powers?). Plays on his pride. Has ordered people to secretly place charges beforehand, where Elias will stand. 
	- Redirected the path of the rail towards the lindwyrm, on advice of alchemist
- First Voltiss was corrupted by a strigoi they discovered in the ravage, gained Vampiric powers. One of the rare aberrances tolerated by the Orthodoxy because they give financial support to many Vigilances; but still tightly supervised. 
- Tempt players to her side or sell them out to Elias, whichever works. 
	- Sell out if 
	- exploit departmental lines?
- STATS: vampire spawn
