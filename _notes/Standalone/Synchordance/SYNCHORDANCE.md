# Synopsis

Change comes slow to the Ravage, and never without a cost.

As the Voltiss Railroad Company drives its spikes across a land of wind-blasted canyons and haunted stone, workers have unearthed trouble deep below ground: a monstrous fossil, one of many legendary beasts driven to extinction but still wrathful in their death. You are a team of exorcists sent by the Synchordant Orthodoxy, blessed fighters and magicians with the ability to put down the haunted corpse of a monster. But trouble brews beyond the reach of the Orthodoxy, and this job may turn out more difficult than it first seems...

# Adventure
## Intro
### Break camp
- Description
	- Dawn in the Ravage - sunrise paints the sky the color of rust. This is a land of black and gray - savage canyons of basalt, ashy soil dotted by scrubland.  These are the remains of some great cataclysm, millennia ago, that choked the world in ash and rent glassy scars across its surface. The last and inevitable conclusion of aberrant magic - which brings us to our heroes, some of the few people tasked with the holy burden of ensuring this conclusion never happens again. 
	- A camp, built on the top bank of a ravine. A tumble of black stone towards a weakly running river. At the top, a campfire burning its last coals; the bundled forms of 3 sleeping bags, their beast of burden, laden with cargo but also dozing. A shadow sneaks at the edge of this camp, a darker outline against the dark soil. Introduce Aymara. 
- Maodannez notices Aymara skulking around camp
	- Scuffle, Lucy gets dragged to edge of ravine, sacks of sodium fly over the edge into river. 
	- ==coordinate with Pati, have her investigate Lucy's stuff
- Lucy: giant pillbug, beast of burden. Leathery plates are gray-brown, speckled with white towards the bottom
	- Carrying exorcism supplies - iron filings, holy water, oil-packed sodium
- Introductions - name, pronouns, appearance
- Lindwyrm fossil discovered in the railway path, draconics usually unsafe for reconstruction
### Elias Hall
- Arrives before too much can happen
- Rider on a long legged sand strider (stickbug like insect). Describe. Greet everyone by name
- Arm in a sling, injured during incident. Narrowly missed by falling rock, but then the lindwyrm got his arm
- Luxor: barghest, fey hound. 3 legged hound-like fossil, bound with the faintest suggestion of glowing musculature. Lanky, deer sized.
	- Very obedient, quiet. Will accept pets. 
- The Vigilance assigned to the railroad project. Was the one who initially sent for exorcists, has ridden out to meet them
- Recently promoted to high vigilance - i think araquiel was disappointed. Maodannez was the teacher's pet
- Private convo with Maodannez - higher ups in Inquests sent Maodannez specifically because they're concerned about his suitability for the role. Insulted a local important magistrate at his last placement
	- Nickname "Mayo", "Danny"
	- You all have all the supplies for the job, right?
	- Make it dangerous to expose aymara
- Has also been chasing rumors of an aberrant magician (aymara). Might try to pin things on her if it gets bad

## Rail Camp
- Description
	- Ravine deepens into a canyon, Dark gray, slightly sparkling walls rising on either side. The river narrows to a trickle then dries up. A few scraggly bushes cling on, lizards. 
	- Railway camp is built at the bottom of the canyon, a small town of tents. Cluttered with mine carts, piles of rubble. Everything coated in a grayish dust. The railroad track bisects the camp, running perpendicular thru the canyon. This is the one place where the rail briefly passes under the sky, but it disappears into the high stone walls on either side. 
	- The train, engine head parked in the middle of camp but the rest of its length disappearing into the western wall. Sleek, silver, smoothly segmented carapace like a millipede. Inconspicuously, a fenced pen built next to the engine where there's a few pigs. 
- Background on the incident
	- Crew made it thru the western wall of the canyon, moved camp to the canyon base. Started blasting thru the eastern wall. Dynamite blast revealed the fossil, initial surge of aberrant magic caused a partial cave in that killed two people
	- Elias was close to the front of the crew, saw the ghostly form of a giant snakelike creature. 
- Carmine Voltiss residing in train engine (counts as lair)
	- Will be in train engine unless it's night. Secretary shows them in
	- Looks at you with a face like she's just eaten a lemon
	- Needle the players, comment on Elias being too inept to handle things himself.
	- [x] plans for original tunnel, then a detour taken towards the lindwyrm
	- [x] contact with Alwick alchemist in Tarrasque.
	- [x] research on draconic breath weapons, past cases of people harnessing them
	- [ ] conflicting orders on dynamite placements?
	- [ ] accounting for voltiss family, a lot of money goes to Orthodoxy
- Elias has a tiny, leaky tent that Carmine always forgets to get repaired
	- it's been terrifically boring out here, hardly anything to do. Unlike last deployment at the Vitrines, single handedly put down a nest of harpies. 
	- [ ] research treatises on various beasts, mostly fey. Descriptions of metamorphosing fey - kelpies go thru a nymph phase, banshees start as will-o-wisps before going thru cocoon
- Railroad workers
	- Bailey (she): gangly youth abt 16. Dirt smeared, bandage on forehead from the accident. A bit slow.
		- Minor sorcerer, able to suppress any magic from the fossils. Might be casting mending, mage hand. He'll try to hide it. 
		- [ ] Has been paid to smuggle, but equally fearful of orthodoxy. Carmine has ordered people to go into the tunnels at night and remove minor fossils, taking them to dropoff points for Tarrasque. Hasn't gone in since the accident because of injury
	- Carson (he): jumpy, whiskered man
		- [ ] Ordered to place dynamite charges the night before - when the time came to detonate, noticed Elias was standing kind of close. Tried to warn but then the order came to detonate. 
		- [ ] Tunnel plans got detoured to go a little south
- [ ] Crates - marked for tarrasque. contain fossils. Being shipped out with pillbugs?
- ==Voltiss found out Myra spied on the accounting for the cargo - unlabelled fossil shipments
	- catch up to them, split the factions
	- she knows it was supposed to be a party of 3, carson reported someone transforming into spider. Elias has been talking about an aberrant mage
	- threaten to sell out Aymara for Maodannez's silence on the matter
- ==Elias has heard Aymara say she'll help==

## Tarrasque
- Description
	- A colossus, swaying in the desert. The size of a castle, small town. The enormous construct of a fossil tarrasque: a cavernous spiked shell tapers to a long spiked tail, columnar legs. But the body truncates abruptly past the shoulders; this is a headless beast, wandering blindly through the wastes. Inside the Tarrasque's ribcage is a densely packed honeycomb of adobe buildings, which look tiny compared to the beast's vast scale. Traders, wanderers, and bandits make landing here, sheltered from the elements and the law. Some aberrant mage reconstructed it some several hundred years ago, and the only reason the Orthodoxy hasn't gotten around to putting it down is that it's so far away from anything important, and it never does anything besides walk the Ravage.
	- A number of rope ladders dangle from the beast's belly, or built into its legs
	- Buildings cram along the bottom and up the sides of the ribcage, a few perch precariously atop the scaled back. The interior of the ribcage is a network of ladders and steps running up and down. It's so cluttered you can barely see the fossil ribs, except for the back vaulting high above you, and a few patches below you where there are gaps for people to enter. It's dim; a few shafts of light stream in from chinks along its armored spine, where the scutes are missing or damaged
	- Smells like sweat and incense, a gabble of different tongues. Ppl of diff species clambering up and amongst the adobe huts; selling or trading, making furtive deals, tossing back shots of moonshine.
- Location protected from elements, on the run from the law, protected from other aberrant beasts/predators
- Bandits working for Alwick have been picking up stuff from Carmine when they pass through the area
- Toil and Trouble: tavern run by a witch
- People might have seen stuff getting brought up, or Elias coming a few months ago
### Ambush
- Let players explore a bit; then ppl start creeping up on them
- Manticore, two goblin bandits (Gulrush, Filbert), maybe bandit captain. Watch time
	- Manticore start with Howl, then use Claw to push PCs off
	- Danger of falling thru ribs - DC13 dex save
	- Passerbys retreat - this seems like a common occurrence here.
- Assailants have a tin flask, inscribed with "Alwick's Rare Ingredients". Some gold inside
- PICK UP: describe surroundings. battles are a common occurrence
### Alwick's Rare Ingredients
- Hobgoblin, bat-like ears, spiky mustache, dark smoked glasses. Chain smoker. new yorker
	- STATS: transmuter wizard
	- bandits are alwick's extended fam protecting his operations
- Alchemist's shop: a hovel built halfway up the side of the ribcage, a tattered sign on top
	- Cluttered and dusty, all sorts of strange reagents and stones. Fragments of fossils in iron-lined cases. Small mage light lamp flickering
	- Stacked crates match the crates seen at rail camp. Inside are fossil fragments sheeted in plaster
- Reconstructing a nixie - meticulously put the bones in place in a circle (like exorcism). prick fingertip (lifeblood), iron filings.
- Has been identifying and experimenting on fossils for Carmine. Neither of them are allowed to be messing with this
	- Has also vaguely inquired about poisons + how easy it is to slip into food
	- If it is a lindwyrm, it won't be useful anyways. no one has successfully reconstructed one
- Advised Carmine on redirecting the tunnel - they detected something there. also following evidence of ancient riverbed
- Carmine knows better than to directly approach the lindwyrm, but brought its "eggshell" (cocoon) in
	- Fossil composition does not suggest calcium; it's a fibrous structure, like it was extruded. Like silk?
- Elias found out Carmine has been in contact here, has pressured Alwick to let him see
	- Examined the egg shell, took a sample
	- Also bought some samples from Alwick, asked him for any research he had on Greater Fey
		- fey tend to have glamours. banshee cocoons
	- Thinks he successfully bribed with some potions
- Short rest
- Potions, all made from beast parts
	- Clairvoyance
	- Gaseous form
	- Heroism
	- Acid resistance
	- Fire breath
- As they leave, a metal cannister with a note is anonymously pressed into Myra's hands
	- It's recognizably Zynthia's handwriting, but the passcode is wrong. Also she never lets typos make it into her writing. 

## The Lindwyrm
### Into the tunnel
- Description
	- squarish tunnel carved into the canyon wall, torches placed at intervals. parallel tracks disappear inside. sides of the tunnel are girded with metal and wood structures. temperature instantly drops 10 degrees. remnant ash/smoke smell
- Explain the exorcism process
- Workers pushing carts out of tunnels, some filled with rocks/debris and others closed wooden crates
	- Carrying slag out of tunnel, the melted tracks + supports from the accident. Bringing them out to a trading post to sell. Carmine keeps them busy even if they can't work on the rail rn
- Stone cracked past a certain point, workers forbidden from going. Thick, tarry rivulets of metal melted then solidified. 
- Nixie fossils along the tunnel walls - filament like white bones, ghostly shapes swimming in the corner of your eye
	- Fishlike, bulbous head and fluked tail, delicately feathered gills. Fairly common, mostly harmless type of fey. This part of the ravage used to be a wetland
	- One fossil of nixie starting to cocoon itself - spitting out thin strands
	- Able to glamour, like all fey. Nixie glamour is pretty weak, disguising itself as rippling water
	- All the fossil fragments earlier in the tunnel have been cleared out. Elias is supposed to dispose of them, but a much larger portion smuggled out
	- Some of the fossils here have been chipped out too. marks of heavy things being dragged out
	- Plaster dust - used to jacket fossils before transport
### The Cavern
- End of the tunnel is empty. Terminates in a vaultlike space. Some of the stone here was instantly incinerated by the uncovering of the lindwyrm
- Explosion disrupted some underground river - water is running fast through a crack in the floor. water is waist high
- One wall is clear of rubble, bears the marks of pickaxes. Someone has been here clearing out stone (removed the fossil)
- A set of footprints in the dust
#### Elias
- Elias appears, the spectral dog following him like a shadow
- Carmine stole the fossil, we have to seize her now
- Actually has resurrected the lindwyrm, is hiding it with glamour
	- would like to arrest Carmine and then use the lindwyrm himself
	- wiping his hands on robes (chalk dust and iron shavings). palm is cut
	- holding a chunk of pale stone (cocoon fossil)
	- seems to be concentrating on something (control over lindwyrm)
	- keeps glancing back at the bare wall
- Get them to realize the lindwyrm is a fey, glamoured > fossil exposes
	- nixies are the young form of lindwyrm
- Fossil: 
	- The glamour falls and you see the fossil before you - delicate fishlike bones, a long spine, the curve of a jaw. It has a halo, like all greater fossils. Not a glow, but a lensing of light around it, a warp in space. Like it is either more or less real than its surroundings. For a moment the stone walls around you disappear - you feel warm water rising around your ankles and the trill of birdsong.
	- Also exposes a summoning circle on the ground - an exorcism circle but reversed
	- Fossils lift off the ground - wrinkly and salamander like
- No one has been able to reconstruct a lindwyrm before, because everyone was treating it like a draconic
- Heard Aymara on the ride into the camp, talking about how she would help Maodannez
	- sure it will look good to the Orthodoxy if he takes her in also
- Maodennez - you never had creativity
- Has colluded with Acquisitions, is going to help them seize power in Orthodoxy. Believes Inquests is a bunch of fat cat beaureaucrats
	- Zynthia is actually planning to double cross him
- Think how the Central Authority will react when they hear that Carmine Voltiss has been tampering with aberrant fossils - to the point where she resurrected a dragon! And the beast got loose and slaughtered herself and her entire workforce, seriously delaying their precious train project... well, I wouldn't be surprised if the Orthodoxy gets much more leeway to control things in the future
- There is no right nor wrong - only power and those who dare to seize it. In that sense dear Carmine and I are rather similar.. the only difference being that I got here first. 
#### Fight
- Exorcism
	- Can reuse the existing summoning circle
	- Place holy water, sodium in five points
	- Trigger electrolysis (device on the wire or lightning spell)
	- While beast is within the circle, successful spell atk against beast's AC? 3 of them?
- Underground river: DC12 dex save to prevent sodium from falling in
- Lindwyrm is large (10ft)
	- start with charged acid breath, then BA turn invisible (spells that require sight don't work)
	- then summon nixies every round
- Elias: sword and smite
	- command to throw items away
- Luxor: teleport ppl away from the circle, or into the river
- Nixies: try to disrupt the ritual, move the items
