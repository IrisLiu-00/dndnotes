Gov research station at some distant location, everyone locked in over the course of a season. Location has magic, but suppresses modern tech (so everyone needs to use swords etc)

Goals
- Length: 10 sessions for season 1
- 3 adventures
- Gameplay: social encounter, missions
- Aesthetic: ww1 era, pseudo military plus medieval
- Tensions/theme: nationalism?
- What's exciting: 
	- Tight cast (only the station crew), good handle on relationships
	- Designing paraphernalia (badges, brochures) 

Insps
- Old Kingdom / abhorsen
- Antarctic research
	- Antarctica McMurdo, wandereatwrite, https://brr.fyi/
	- From Australian antarctic program - “what is your motivation for working with the australian antarctic program? If you’re looking to escape a difficult relationship or situation, Antarctica is not the answer.”
	- [The Biology of Human survival: life and death in extreme environments](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266570285_The_Biology_of_Human_Survival_Life_and_Death_in_Extreme_Environments)
- Annihilation (van der meer)

Campaign
- What is the nature of the anomaly
	- what makes it hard to access / why are they locked in
	- big storm, cloud cover
	- periodic volcano
	- natural geothermal or nuclear reactors in the ground
	- it only appears in the real world, once per year? pocket dimension
	- i like the eternal winter darkness of antarctica
	- a destroyed kingdom. strange ruins, ghosts? arches hanging in the air. monsters that were once human
- Central conflict: 
	- man vs nature, survival
	- bbeg has to be someone working at the station
	- give them a mission to do? research goals?
	- Discovery of some natural resource for energy (hydrogen? Sth more exotic) > company invasion?
	- some sleeping evil within the ruins. theres a monster eating ppl
- WWI era tech, stops working close to the anomaly. Ppl use swords and horses and magic
- Ppl at the station divided into research, security/military, services (food, comms). PCs pick a role
- A failed, covered up expedition decades ago. government conspiracies
- or a small mining space station?

Adventures
- monster fighting (boring)
	- human like monsters - the corrupted citizens of the old kingdom. harpies, manticores
	- lost explorers become monsters too? is this too similar to annihilation
- amogus / imposter
- restoring failed comms tower
