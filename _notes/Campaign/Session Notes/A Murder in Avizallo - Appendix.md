# Background

## The Conspiracy

Sahuagin fray wraith zombies 
- Owl killed a bunch of sahuagin, did a necromancy-adjacent ritual to convert them into fray wraiths
	- vacating the corpse of its natural magic, inviting the fray in
	- resulting wraiths count as Aberrations but have some undead attributes, can be kind of commanded (or do they need to be boxed up and transported?)
- Can leave dead bodies when destroyed, unlike true wraiths. Also look more humanoid, while true wraiths only have a rough impression of a living thing
- Owl using them to sow conflict, attack the reservoir
- Need to be stored in range of Owl's control - in a nook at the back of Eledeia's cove
	- Reduced to their skulls, submerged in water
	- Also need to be replenished relatively often bc they don't keep
Controlling Automata
- New feature on latest models allows remote control thru a device
	- increased height improves range on the remote signal
- Owl is getting Mettlewise to fly the automata controlling kites at specified locations
	- Mettlewise thinks the kites have surveillance equipment to catch petty crimes - Owl let her think it was her idea, helped develop the equipment
	- some kites also disperse fliers for the temple (could be a good plot hook!)
- Valespinner has a transponder to hijack Eledeia's automata and control them, disguised as part of a device to distribute leaflets
	- Owl stole one of the automata to synthesize the key. The automata later turned up drowned + damaged.
		- Owl paid a visit to Eledeia estate once, to discuss donations to the temple
	- Merriwink paid Myla (featherweight) to install the device. Myla got the aerial leaflet printer as a sample from Kingswill Trading
- discreetly transport automata by loading a bunch into cargo container, have one push it around - cargo loading automata are fairly common with the Giltstern crew
	- also use to transport sahuagin in cargo
Reservoir Attacks
- Owl gets more latitude to move after Gyrfalcon taken out
- Planning to systematically take out reservoirs in each column to search for Cory's true name / info on Nexida, weaken Avizallo (need to import water or import Felichian priests)
	- Cisterns are connected to Tensorat's old workshop
- Use sahuagin to attack bc automata can't go in water
- Reservoir system of La Sul was destroyed a few weeks ago
	- Fray attack at the docks at night to cause chaos, disguise noise of Shatter. Aboveground entrances of reservoir are guarded at night but interior is empty.
	- Owl had Corinsson cast Water Breathing on her, swam up the bottom of reservoir. Cast Dispel Magic to destroy the glyphs, Shatter to tear apart the waterwheel. Then have wraiths carry out all the precious metals so it's harder to repair. 
	- Currently being repaired - Owl is able to search for Tensorat's lab while she supervises the drained reservoirs
	- Gyrfalcon has now posted guards inside the reservoirs at night, at Owl's behest
Kingswill Trading Co.
- Small Kevaran-based trading company - actually a shell company
- Any real shipping they do is contracted out to Giltstern
- Registered under Morgana Saire, resident of Kevara-Arda
- Use shell company to requisition cargo crates, use of the freight elevators
- Kevaran Traders guild was tied on whether to provide the government with more funding for naval presence around Avizallo, until Kingswill trading joined the guild and voted to increase naval presence
- Launder money gained from Giltstern 
	- use money to buy black diamonds - used to resurrect fray wraiths (needs like 300gp per sahuagin)
	- use to pay someone to reverse engineer a key for krystin's automata
- Planted leaflet printer as a sample sent to Featherweight
- Informed Avizallo gov they were culling sahuagin to clear out a dock for ships - one of the small glass atolls around the isle
	- didn't actually build a dock, owl just went a killed a bunch of sahuagin
- Described as "Ruler's Desire" in encoded communiques

## The Murder
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding her out, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- Gyrfalcon became suspicious, see clues below
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence between Orin + Gandras
		- Macaw accidentally left one of Orin's letters at the Rookery
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
- Incite the riot by having automata fire into the strikers
	- actually Kingfisher's automata under her control, not Giltstern's
- faked lividity by beating up the body - corinsson casted Lightning Arrow to get electrocution burns
- use the automata, crates to deliver body to the site of riot (during the chaos)
# NPCs
## The Councillors

*all insight checks against the Court have disadvantage bc they're masked*

**Owl**: the mastermind (stats- essential npcs priest?)
- why did Owl ask V for help? 
	- she knows someone took out Leanna, and wants to bait them (how would she know is PCs)
	- trying to frame Kevaran intruders, incite further conflict
	- try to manipulate the PCs to get them to blame someone else (Kingfisher or Giltstern)
- Might not wear her prayer beads around now - or wear them in a different color
- Alibi: praying at the temple. corroborated by other priests, templegoers
- Zone of Truth: will answer with some performed reservation. ring allows lying
**Raven**: parallel investigating
- Alibi: asleep (lie), probably doing some assassins creed shit
- Zone of Truth: refuse to cooperate if she doesn't trust PCs
- Gyrfalcon asked them a few months ago on records of past fray tides
**Macaw**: unknowing accomplice (how), corrupt, soft/optimistic on kevara
- Alibi: working late in the office (lie), can't say he rushed to the riots as Gandras

**Vulture**: 
- Was the most vocally opposed to gyrfalcon -
- Alibi: refuse to talk to outsiders? but he was working late in the office, did not see Macaw
- Zone of Truth: refuse to cooperate
**Kingfisher**: 
- Alibi: Krystin was near the riot (conferring with Giltstern abt another automata purchase). Might say she was with a business associate/client?

- Pressuring Gandras Dol to repay his debts. Annoyed at Gandras' inability to suppress saltwood workers

- Residing on the moored Giltstern flagship 
- [ ] Communications
	- From Gyrfalcon (day before riot): I'll warn you again to keep your hired muscle off of the columns; and for that matter, they shouldn't be on civilian-use docks either. I will be at the picket line starting tomorrow morning. Don't think of trying anything. 
	- To Macaw (few days ago): I'd like for us to meet on board Conviviant, this next Sixthday. We need to do some real damage control around this damn strike, and I remind you of your other obligations as well. Do the bare minimum and bring your next installment when we meet. 
	- From Owl (month ago): I would appreciate you (and other traders) limiting the number of Felichian missionaries you charter to the Isle. I understand your flagship has a company of 250 sailors that require a stone's worth of libations per day, but work that takes them inland can be as easily handled by those automata you've purchased. I would hope you could order these changes by ruler's desire. 
		- _coded message to get black diamonds via kingswill. the flagship needs far more than 250 sailors. what is a stone of libations? Ruler's Desire?_
	- To Kingfisher (half a yr ago): I have word that your shipment should come in by sixthday. The boxes are marked with Luca Industries but I'll send an attendant to deliver them to you. It's been a pleasure doing business.
