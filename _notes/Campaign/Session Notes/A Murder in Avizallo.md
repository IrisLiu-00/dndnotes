## Journey to Avizallo
#### Picking a Ship
- Fray exposed sailors, bleached and worn looking
- Atlas: leviathan, a giant living water beast. a whale, edges of its being bubble away like seafoam
	- Josephine Avila: half sun elf, granddaughter of Azolar Avila. Privateer captain. Spanish accent?
		- stats: [Viona Zarr](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpCTXodA-AcFL7kARWmunwSxRWCPAE8L/view)
	- Aleksei: lynx tabaxi first mate
		- stats: Jarram
	- Solas + Iolas: human twin deck wizards. Responsible for casting modified Air Bubble spells.
		- stats: Deck Mage (under Harek)
		- Casting a large size air bubble across the whole leviathan takes concentration; they work in 6 hour shifts. 
	- Can cut thru (under) the Fray - will get there 4 days in advance of Giltstern
	- Making a stop at Avizallo to take on water, before heading north in search of Azolar Avila's treasure
- Conviviant: Giltstern supply ship taking Isaiah Giltstern to Avizallo for negotiations
	- Oscar: gruff quartermaster
	- Sylvie: head of felichian missionaries
	- Pay your way (500gp), or find some other way
- Ole Snuff's Saltwater Tugg: tiny sloop, somehow built with saltwood. Covered/disguised with a tarp
	- Ole Snuff: captain, scrawny orc, owes treasure to Josephine, on the run
	- Berbert: big bloodhound. Became intelligent + got opposable thumbs thru a Medallion of Wit (stolen from Josephine)
	- Happy to take passengers. Will get attacked by Atlas almost immediately
#### The Journey
- Before leaving
	- Where is the stripper pole installed?
	- Servant (mild mannered eastener) finds the party before leaving and gives them a dossier on Avizallo. Warn them not to let Giltstern know that they're there to protect the deal. 
	- Merriwink calls to give Toby his second task: steal the Valespinner for her, from her "evil" twin Mettlewise
- Scene setting: the departure
	- Josephine calls Iolas - no, Solas to be first watch on the air bubble spell. Steps up to the forehead of the leviathan and rests a hand on its giant horn. A spray of mist ejected from its blowhole - water rains down over the Kevara docks, kids shriek and wave in delight. Solas waves their hands over a giant sigil tattooed on the sea monster's spine, and the saltwater spray hanging in the air collects to form an iridescent membrane around you all. A cheer rises from the pirates as the monster beats its flukes and sinks. 
	- Very low light - a few dark blue rays filter down. Bioluminescent patterns on Atlas' skin light up. Pirates sit down in hammocks strung along the sides, a few climb up long spines for first watch. 
	- Few hours into the ocean, the water above loses all transparency - the milk white of the Fray.
- What do the PCs do for the 3 week journey?
	- Food is unremarkable - hard tack soaked in soup. Iolas amuses the crew by spearing fish with magic missiles
	- Josephine knows the court of birds?
	- stuff abt coriolis?
- Water gets shallower, Atlas has to breach. Lots of tiny black glass isles, choked with seagrass.
- Josephine sends crew onto the atolls to hunt for giant rockfish, which come to lay their eggs. but watch out for sahuagin!
	- sahuagin can dive under water if they have extra movement
- Kevaran navy ships patrolling around Avizallo, naval protection as part of the deal. Hostile to most. 
	- details
## Day 1
#### Arrival in the Isle
La Sul
- Scene setting
	- High white vanishing fog of the fray. It clears, and you get a glimpse of a reflection - sunlight on black glass, refracted blue and violet in the morning light. Five pillars rise from the ocean, wreathed by white mist at their base. Small black dots of birds spiralling around the tips.
	- The top of each pillar is crowned with lush greenery, vines and trees. Set amidst them like jewels are multicolored houses. Birds of every sort (gulls, parrots) wheel and deal in the air, raucous squawking.
	- Draw closer - you see the famed saltwood trees, which look nothing much like trees. White fingers claw their way up the base of each pillar, stark contrast with the black translucence. Built amongst the vertically growing shoots are docks, their wood coated a darker color with waterproofing. Ships large and small pull in gingerly between the gnarled, bone-white roots of the trees. All of the ship have the characteristic white hulls of saltwood hewn, deepwater bound vessels. 
	- People at work in the docks, unloading cargo holds to these elevators that travel on rails up the length of the columns. Food and textiles from trading ships into the isle
- Location: La Sul. Bargewrights, ships, Giltstern.
- Josephine has trouble getting water - an official directing ppl to caskets being brought in from the other isles. Fountains r down. 
- Owl chivvying away some Felichian missionaries. Approaches PCs
	- Sporadic fray wraith attacks recently, some saltwood growers injured/killed. Avizallo's own military power isn't great, doesn't fully trust Giltstern either
	- mentioned problems to Vasilev, who said he would send ppl over
	- can show the PCs over to the groves
La Varza, the saltwood groves
- White barked trees, reaching like skeletal fingers above the water. Very few leaves. Lots of roots spider around each other and cling to crevices in the glass. Wooden docks crisscross between the roots. 
- Druids lined up on one of the docks, some of them holding signs: "Kevaran leeches off our backs", "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work", "Gandras Dol, Giltern's puppet"
- Few other citizens standing back and watching (incl Sabra)
- At the front of the line, Gyrfalcon and Gandras. Gandras has a number of automata behind him. 
	- Gandras Dol: tall, brown skinned man. Dressed in a well tailored sleeveless coat, well tailored arms bared. Half laughing, trying to be polite. 
	- Gyrfalcon: You cannot bring those here, Mister Dol. As a civilian you have no right to use armed enforcement against other citizens. 
	- Dol: Come now, shouldn't a man have a right to see to the security of his own private lands? I don't like to do it, but until the situation is resolved, I need some way to prevent damages to my property. Giltstern enterprises has supplied me with a solution. 
	- Gyrfalcon: I will remind you that the saltwood groves are not your land, they have only been leased to you by the court of birds. I will be bringing this to the court, and then we'll see how much longer you can bring this Kevaran scum onto our docks. 
- Giltstern standing on a higher terrace, turns away
- Fray wraiths attack. Gandras will order automata to help fight. 
	- Fray wraiths come in from sea and engage automata, druids, gyrfalcon. As they're distracted another group comes in from the side, going for the civilians
	- they leave dead bodies when killed - unusual for true wraiths
- Opportunity to explore city:
	- La Sul reservoir is non functional
	- Kareem's, Bargewrights. show the kite fights.
	- people: owl, macaw, raven/zora (spying), giltstern
	- have them figure out where they're staying for the night
- Saved Sabra's life, they are now staying at the Dol mansion
- Everyone bought a kite, Sabra and Toby are going to practice
- Went to Bargewrights. 2 Giltstern sailors, starting to talk to Titus. 
	- Titus has a heavy ring on his pinky. Wife Ella comes demanding child support
how to demonstrate automata remote control. show them coming back to roost as they leave?
meet up with owl

## Day 2
#### Riot and Murder
- At evening, Giltstern issued remote order to recall automata - he needs extras to unload a shipment in time
- PCs may or may not be at the saltwood docks - either way Gyrfalcon is on a dock further away
- Macaw got there first, then reappeared later as Gandras. Told Bluemoon he will bring a footman for safety but didn't (in order to sneak away as Macaw)
- Riot events (if you ask anyone it's unclear what happened)
	- Gandras/Giltstern ordered automata to stand watch - against wraiths, or potential damage from strikers
	- Some say the riot started bc strikers threw rocks, or bc a wraith was spotted, or the automata just started firing into the crowd
	- Number of workers were killed
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- Tight mask, headwrap slightly loose. Clothing rumpled.  Boot laces are slightly loose (assassin put them on). 
	- Pockets: bit of money
	- Body has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for 500 extra gold. Don't let it go to war. Make the saltwood deal go thru. 
	- Insight check: a little edge of ruthless desperation. Pissed if they weren't at the docks.
- Titus, some other druids taken for questioning. Released pretty quickly.
	- (off screen) Ella complains he won't be able to pay child support. Owl breaks them up, steals the ring.
#### The Council Meeting
- early morning, 6am. a cloud of starlings, small green parrots squawk. cargo elevators groan to life, dockworkers hauling in the lifeblood of the isles. 
	- up and down winding paths in the natural, uneven surface of the black glass. across a swaying rope bridge a few hundred feet long to La Centra. 
- rookery: describe
	- sparse crowd milling in front of the rookery: hawk masked guards, sparrow masked functionaries coming to work. A growing throng of commoners, murmurs of unrest
	- Giltstern is here. broad shouldered, mane of gold hair
- meeting in the hall. bannister divides viewing area from the court, guards lined up. court of birds on a circle of six chairs, one empty. Gyrfalcon's shrouded body
	- Vulture, dark cloaked; Owl, straightening prayer beads; Kingfisher, poised; Raven, silent; Macaw, rushing in late
- Q/A session, anyone can shout questions. A guard rings a bell to cast silence on the ppl.
- Vulture: call into session. Gyrfalcon was killed in an altercation at La Varza docks early this morning. Kevaran automata were involved
- Kingfisher: western saltwood druids have flat out refused to harvest the trees until justice is done. War hawk factions are calling for blood. Saltwood deal is under threat
- Owl: need to unmask Gyrfalcon - first step to understanding what happened
	- mask cannot be removed unless all the others come to consensus
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs, Giltstern) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Giltstern: willing to fully cooperate. He called his automata back to La Sul last night.
- Raven/Owl can mention that Gandras barely stayed to help out at the riot scene
- Vulture: need to start process for another civil service exam
- Opinions
	- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
	- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
	- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
	- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
	- Raven stays silent
- What's next (recs from Owl)
	- scene of the crime (riot)
	- talk to ppl who know what's up w the city (Myla, Kareem)
	- giltstern
- investigated riot site, now its 12pm
	- found broken crate w Orin's body
	- talk to seagull - they know the body was transported there in a crate, and the other automata left via crate
	- asked a bunch of kevarans abt Kingswill, ersatz told them some things
### Following the Automata
- Crew found automata track (skid mark) at top of la varza elevator, going towards La Centra
- Mention kites wheeling overhead
	- A lot of ppl pushing crates work for Eledeia. No one has seen automata delivering crates topside
- Justification (magic/cool idea)? tracking urban area is tough
- Hidden cove, battle
	- front wave of automata, 1-2 in back smash a sahuagin skull > go to Toby+Sabra at top of round
	- only a few overridden automata responsible for hiding the cove, try to keep PCs out
	- rapid water in underwater grotto sends the wraith to opposite side of column, towards core plantations
- Left one destroyed automata (crystal removed). Other automata will remember the break in, tidal wave in cave
	- Remaining automata ordered by Owl to hide evidence of sahuagin
	- the 2 sahuagin zombies escaped, attacking druids. Shouts across the water. Druids are going to do a hardcore perimeter, prevent further entry to the saltwood docks. 
- Info
	- They need to understand politics more, the ban on building ships
	- Let them find black diamonds, silk, balsa wood in the crates when they come back up? 
	- Crystal - automata are deeded to Eledeia estate. Have two sets of orders. One issued by verbal command to build ship, guard the cove. One issued by remote command to carry skulls into the cave, release them on command.
- Now mid afternoon. Next steps?
### Toby's Date
- Toby rushed back late to his date with Sabra, seems to have patched things up. they're going to Kareem's Beans
- Potential to notice Zora spying
- Met Mettlewise, Toby revealed he knows Merriwink
- Consequences for toby leaving the group, make him choose - difficult encounter, need his help if they get captured
- Garden grotto at L'Esta - waves make musical sounds against the caves. Wraiths wash out here
### The Aftermath
- Sent Sabra back home
- Told Owl abt Eledeia + hidden cove, Owl ordered capture of Eledeia
- Questioned in front of Court of Birds
	- Automata remote got stolen, she doesn't know anything about the skulls or gyrfalcon's murder
	- Isaiah wants Eledeia killed, made an example of
- Kallista found the Eledeia remote has been stolen. Bluemoon tracked using crystals to Valespinner. They stole it off of the Feather Scouts
- Found remote built into the Valespinner device, marked with Featherweight
	- Modified to act as a satellite, someone is commanding from a distance
### Zora's Ambush
- Met in Bargewrights, offered information about Myla, Gyrfalcon's id
- Motives?
	- was working for Eledeia as intel, thinks the PCs are Kevarans trying to frame Eledeia. Dislike Eledeia but agreed on her goals. Surprised she turned out to be Kingfisher
	- identified PCs as Kevarans - Kallista's fashion is 2 seasons ahead, Lumdas is carrying a Felichian symbol
- Ambush with shadows in elevator. maybe dont go right into initiative
	- elevator stops. lights blink off. the flick of the lighter
	- Zora: who's paying you? Giltstern or some duke on his bankroll? Bunch of newcomers in town right before a prominent murder, I'm sure he thought he was being subtle. Can't believe Eledeia's leaving me to clean up her messes. Tell me how you killed Gyrfalcon or I'm sure my friends higher up will have much more creative interrogation methods. 
	- Zora go invisible immediately, taunt the players. maybe counterspell
	- Resolve: convince Zora they're not part of the conspiracy/working for Giltstern
- Zora has info
	- (Raven) gyrfalcon was looking for info on Corinsson's disappearance
	- Knows a good bit about most of the council. With Eledeia gone, Vulture is the remaining block on unmasking Gyrfalcon. Blackmail Vulture w info that 
	- Very likely that gyrfalcon's murderer knew their true identity
	- Message from Eledeia, passwords to rookery. players will need to get their own guards masks
### Reservoir Attack
- Explosion when they return late at night - fountain cracked, wraiths swarm the square
- Large fountain in front of Dol's mansion is off for the night. Priests run from it, wraiths stream out
- Guards around the reservoir have been in disarray since Gyrfalcon's death
- Waterwheel destruction suggests intelligent agent. Couldn't have been Eledeia since she's in prison
	- Owl: Eledeia could have lied about the skulls, was working with some third party necromancer to orchestrate the attacks. Or Giltstern is trying to threaten Avizallo

### Eledeia + Bluemoon
- Party sneaks into the rookery
	- getting into the restricted area of rookery - passphrases sellwen, incarnum, threelet
- unsure if bluemoon has sold out to kevaran interests. assumes the party is working for giltstern or sth
- she built the ships for the good of Avizallo
- Would like to preserve the ship if possible
- Doesn't trust the other councilors, one of them could be murderer. Giltstern has too much to lose in a drawn out siege, unless he was guaranteed of a quick victory. Gyrfalcon had more enemies at home (Macaw, Vulture). Was suspicious of Macaw/Gandras connection.

# Day 3

## Morning
- Water rationing order given by Owl
	- Gandras' household has to go line up at La Centra
	- Rumors of the attacks being sponsored by Giltstern, further unrest at the docks
	- Strengthen avizallo guard presence at the docks
- Giltstern makes an offer: free shipments of water from the mainland, in return for Eledeia's death and an advantageous saltwood price
- does owl just free all the wraiths, now that she doesn't have a storage place? just attack things indiscriminately
- Talked to Sabra, nothing that important. but she's coming with the party now??
	- Conflicting viewpoint with Myla

## The Featherweight Again
- Gandras - don't go downcolumn, there's rabble there. Not while there's this much unrest. 
- People milling about in the streets, unrest. Roll for rumors
	- Giltstern is behind the reservoir attacks, they want to sell us water in addition to everything else
	- Why else would Giltstern have murdered the head of the guard if not to make us vulnerable
	- Council is weak and scared, unwilling to move
	- Eledeia arrested - split on if she betrayed for Giltstern, it's a Kevara psyop, or if unrelated
	- Gandras Dol is in Giltstern's pocket, going to call for more robots to break the strike. 
	- Workers loading crates from elevators, people in line for water at la centra. Soldiers stand around, not always enforcing order
	- ships aren't coming in port bc of fear of unrest at the docks, no water
- Show Myla's POV on politics, her angling for stuff

## Unmasking Gyrfalcon
- Owl/Zora lets them know that Vulture conceded, Gyrfalcon is unmasked. Council is working on identifying the body
	- Zora already knows Gyrfalcon's identity. Offers in exchange for stealing upcoming test scrolls (Eledeia still wants them for Myla). Not a bad idea to snoop around in the council either
		- Owl and Vulture write the exams, raven has no access
		- Players also need to examine the body again, get other clues from Rookery
		- guard presence has increased around rookery since recent unrest. Besides new passwords, probably need mask disguises. 
- Told Owl about Zora's offer. Knows a female PI going by Z wants the exam, Owl thinks is probably Raven
	- Owl providing fake exams, half a day
- Look at Gyrfalcon's body again. Speak with dead cast, uneffective
- Guard station: Mettlewise foiled. kite is taped under drawer at home
	- spy on them? report to Owl that theyve stolen. Owl trusts Mettlewise, will come get the kite. 
- Late afternoon, they give the fake exam to Zora
	- Zora identified them as fake, fears Owl might know about her. 
	- Party successfully deceived her that they just stole the wrong copy
	- Theyre going to go back, return the old exams, make copy
## Rookery Theft
- Late at night
- Guard presence has increased after reservoir attacks
- toby goes in, more guards come. they find octavius
- Toby steals Orin's letter, Owl's prayer idol, gyrfalcon's papers
	- prayer idol buried outside dol's house. sabra saw. necklace buried over it
	- Papers burned
	- Owl is gonna know someone broke into her office, gyrfalcon's. someone might have figured out orin's handwriting match
- Hallway to locked door: guards posted watching for ppl wearing the masks
	- they already have the latest passcodes to enter the door
- Tension score increases with each failure, max 3? 1/3
	- Tension increases with failed check, each round of combat, unconscious body found, loud noise
	- Fail state: chase. separate skill encounter to avoid capture. 
		- 3rd: guards barring the way. 2nd: ?? 1st: desks in the way, more guards
		- party gets framed as causing a distraction for the sake of the reservoir attack
	- Making a loud sound, raising suspicion of guard so they go talk to others, leaving evidence behind
- Owl tell them abt Zora if they don't find her stuff
	- Owl: zora is trying to insert her own choice as the next councillor. she stole the automata key from eledeia. 
- La Centra reservoir is destroyed while the party is occupied
	- alarm, all the guards at Rookery deployed
	- a number of guards tried to get to the reservoir going up the flank of la centra (were coming from deployments at the docks) - were shot dead on the flank of la centra
	- next morning, councillors agree to Giltstern's proposal. a public trial will be held for Eledeia. Giltstern starts shipping in casks of water from mainland
- they don't give the exams to Zora

# Day 4

## To Skymark's House
- Downcolumn La Varza
- Press of bodies, striking saltwood workers
- Lot of lit torches, fear sweat, watchful against wraiths. They've extended the barricade around the shantytown to protect people here
- Titus and crew have discovered the party is living w Gandras, will not allow them to cross the picket line
	- spies for giltstern? scabs? tampering with the reservoirs, with gyrfalcon's death?
	- have maybe also figure out theyre foreign, based on the questions theyve been asking
- Sahuagin wraith boss ambush inside house. Add another wraith if needed
	- boss gets surprise round
	- rest of party at picket line, group check to try to get there in time. DC 19 to get there 0 rounds, 16 1 round, 13 2 rounds, below 13 for 3 rounds.
## The Assassin
- Has been watching for anyone going to the Skymark house. Or they tell Owl, and Owl tells assassin
- Shooting from flank of La Norza. 600ft away northwest. Blinded by setting sun. 
- Party on cliffside of la varza or a bridge. 90ft to get to cover
	- coming up from la varza (why not the elevator?) or a path towards the bridge/gandras house
- Sniper's nest - foliage, crushed down in the middle where a person has been crouching
	- shattered hawk mask? violet diamond? tracks to the reservoir?
- After this they should be pointed to la centra reservoir
	- map of the reservoirs, all the rest crossed out
	- la norza reservoir was destroyed in the meantime?
	- sniper shoots them a message to meet in la centra?
## Return
- crier: councillors agree to Giltstern's proposal. a public trial will be held for Eledeia. Giltstern starts shipping in casks of water from mainland
- bait them back home? or they just pass by the house on their way to wherever
- Try to arrest the party for theft of Owl's stuff. Owl, Mettlewise, Sabra, 20 guards
	- merriwink comes around asking after the party (looking for kite). sabra says something was buried there. merriwink digs and finds Owl's prayer idol, report to sponsor of feather scouts. Owl will now know that they broke in, has figure out Orin's handwriting. 
	-  Owl suggest theyve been working for Zora, Zora probably killed Gyrfalcon - raided her apartment and say she found Eledeia study key
- Zora goes into hiding, no one able to find her
- the rest got let go, toby taken. 8 hrs to get proof
- start at the rookery
	- owl thumbing her new prayer beads
	- owl ask what proof they have that its orin's name
	- can't find zora
	- all of toby's equipment taken
### Toby in Prison
- Dirt cell, no windows. Toby's cell has a bowl of gruel, rusting manacles on the wall. Storm drain. Single set of stairs back up. 
	- Past another locked gate: belongings, gyrfalcon's body
	- Eledeia can cast spells but she doesn't have her focus (spellbook)
	- Tensorat's work prevents teleporting past walls/doorways in the rookery
- Need to find cause of death
	- Eledeia: has worked w automata, gyrfalcon's injuries don't quite look like automata shocks. maybe poison?
	- 
- Automata replace the prison guards - simultaneous attacks from fray wraiths on the two remaining reservoirs. 
	- Giltstern moves against Macaw, Vulture in the Rookery. Basically takes them hostage with automata; offers to save the reservoirs/defend against wraiths/supply water if they capitulate. Wants the treaty rewritten to secure Kevaran interests even more
- Storm drain starts flooding (is connected to reservoirs). Automata will do nothing, have no orders to help.
	- direct them into storm drain, into reservoir
- Mushika has found cause of death, keys to get out. water rising
### Everyone else

- Contacted by Zora?
	- what will happen if avizallo loses its means for self subsistence? a slow death. parceled away to Kevara or its highest bidder
- Giltstern charging money for premium access to water
- more wraith attacks on the reservoirs. Giltstern automata move in by force to protect their assets
- Get them to figure out that it's Owl, then have them chase her into reservoir?
	- could go the handwriting path
	- kingswill to owl? ersatz comes in with more information abt kingswill registration to a felichian priest
	- owl's prayer totem (mettlewise has it)
		- its actually felichian - back side carved w a dodecahedron filled w waves, symbol of chance + fate
		- teleportation compartment, giltstern has the other half. Inside is a sack of 50 gold, a note - Thinking I will have some space in the hold. Anything for Ruler's Desire? Here's the change for that last deal.
- Get into La Centra reservoir to meet up w toby
	- owl spotted entering reservoir
	- derelict service entrance behind Kareem's Beans
- followed teleportation compartment to giltstern ship, encountered Zora
	- zora suggest to catch owl / confront her in the reservoir, seems like there's something sus she's doing there
	- they've been looking for her and she's not there
	- zora can take them to the entrance now that she's disguised?
	- figure out resources + rest
## Into the Reservoirs
### Entrance
- Total darkness, figure out light
- Long shaft, 15ft diameter. Periodic ledges along the side. Walls slick and wet
- Storm drain is a chute of upwards moving water, with a window opening to one of the platforms. The source of the water continues downwards
	- Runes painted along the chute are alight, directing the water upwards without spilling from the opening
- Above: wreckage of a destroyed waterwheel blocks access. Dim sounds of fighting above. Otherwise quiet, dripping water
	- Waterwheel destroyed in a rapid decompression that pulled all the water down + away
	- engineered by Tensorat

- Smaller waterwheel secured within the shaft, cracked. Runes painted on the blades for purification
	- platforms on either side for priests to stand in, work the spell
	- Claw marks in the wood where things climbed up
- complications: slippery algae, cut/stuck on wooden shards or glass, accidentally activate a rune (water or wheel spins), directly fall into the shaft, 
- 150 down ft to platform branching off: 100 ft drop to a narrow, dark hole, 4ft diameter
	- scrap of Owl's robe caught on the hole
	- Pure darkness below. If light source thrown in, a liquid reflection (gel cube)
### Fight
- Hole drops directly onto gelatinous cube (drop down takes half movement)
- Narrow corridor with a slight downward list
- Cubes: slowly digesting dead fish inside. a couple of magic objects
	- block bottlenecks and move towards nearest source of heat
	- gel2: portable hole, brooch of panther
	- gel3: tiebreak sandals

- large wooden shelves, bizarre spell components, springs, gears, mechanical tools
- ornate rug on the floor, large mirror on the ceiling
- Letters/journals? Faded, papery scrawl, very old
	- They are looking for me their eyes are everywhere watching for me I know it. They envy and fear the work I have done what I am so close to making but I will show them all I have hidden and hidden away deeper and deeper
	- Supplies and sustenance Corin brings me although I know his humor is wearing short. But I need him still I need only a few more days until the bottle is completed. 
	- He speaks of a son but I do not think he will miss him
- rolling up the rug reveals a plain glass floor, but in the mirror there is a wooden trapdoor
- can climb thru mirror to the other room, which looks identical except for the trap door

	- combo 7777 unlocks the door, another downward sloping corridor
	- Healing potions: 
	- remind them of healthy lunch
### Boss Fight
- Metal and waxen seal, stamped with arcane runes. Has been broken
- Tumble down a long slope into a rounded cavern, shape like a flask
	- Deep within the column - when the tide rose it would have made this place completely airtight
- Two voices
	- Owl: what is the meaning of this. I wait all these years, turn the isles upside down - only to find that another has been here before me?
	- Corinsson: I do not know, master
	- Owl: No. Nor did I bring you back to give your opinion.
	- there must be further information on the isles somewhere - once it is completely under her control
	- Owl is concerned w getting the djinni's name; made a deal with Giltstern for aid
- Carved into the sloped crystalline ceiling (not carved, but melted out)
	- Air elemental, wind ephemeral, immortal djinni; I entrap you so my will shall be done. I bind your breath; you will enact my wish by my intent. I bind your body; you will never undo my will by your power. I bind your soul; you will never reveal the nature of my wish. I bind you thus, by your true name -- scrawled out
	- painted in bright red: what's in a name? the QUEEN OF THIEVES claims this bounty.
- Corin long range at top of ledges
- Owl mid range
- continue: kallista and lumdas both down. does anyone remaining have healing things?
- minion wraiths: summoned by Owl as bonus action. barely more than a skeleton. close range
	- shambling, semi-transparent
	- 1hp, only melee attack
- ledges: each 5ft high, cost 10ft movement. Factor height into ranged attacks
	- standing directly in the lee of a ledge gives cover from attacks from higher ledges
- Runes on the ledges produce Wall of Wind if both are touched in succession
	- Both walls can't be up at same time
	- gusts of wind around toby, trying to bind in place - some residue of magic bound the genie and is trying to bind you to
		- flashback? on tobys next turn?
		- owl tries to get corin's name from toby once she realizes
	- when all 4 runes activated/when toby activates a rune - get an impression of a consciousness from far away. a pool of enormous magic - you get the feeling you could ask for something to tip the scales in your favor. 
		- flashback - childhood on cliffs. toby levitates, annalise is worried, talk about Cory. Parallels with bluemoon?
		- full heals/long rest for everyone
- Owl will target bluemoon next, remark on his father - recognized him as the son of Vapor. Was experimenting with the construction of wraiths some years back, it was a pity his father had to die. Lay down and I may spare you as well.
- owl remark on them being close to death. much easier than expected, would have arranged an unfortunate accident much earlier
- battle should go no longer than 3/4 rounds
- Taking out Owl kills all the others
- finale where the water rushes back up? owl killed, incantation broken
	- skill challenge? 3 successes/failures. Up the flask, the twisting corridor (gels), the drop, the wrecked waterwheel
	- come out the hole - the shafts of automata crossbows - raven parts the wave, stands them down
### Conclusion
How is avizallo going to resolve
- Raven/Zora manage to rout the automata, give orders to avizallo guards
- giltern trying to hostile takeover - justification of the wraith threat. now that's destroyed, giltstern can't stay
	- raven confronts? giltstern has no legal basis, there is no threat. he will not get kevara naval backing, nor the wraiths from Owl. a bunch of ragtag adventurers stopped it, giltstern was useless. 
	- in fact, giltstern has pushed the bounds of the treaty and avizallo may exact a price in the saltwood trade
	- have PCs show proof that owl was behind it and working with giltstern. he gets a slap on the wrist from the traders guild
- owl selling the isles to kevara
- the strikers
Epilogues for everyone
- ask ppl to think abt what their charas do after
- Bluemoon - does he cheat and become a councillor?
- Toby - follow the trail of his father?
	- merriwink might give info abt the queen of thieves
- Lumdas - morgana saire and the golden king?
	- father thrain can talk abt how she got kicked out
- Kallista
	- clockwork reappears? vasilev made a deal

What's next
- they need to learn
	- Gyrfalcon's mouth shot. from raven?
	- tensorat's history? helped engineer the reservoirs. 
	- point to reservoir
- Owl is going to
	- try to get the kite from them? acting on behalf of mettlewise. break into house?
	- somehow move against raven/zora
	- bait them into the reservoir where she can kill them? implicate zora?
	- need to establish her motives for killing better
- Eledeia
	- Giltstern wants her life in exchange for water shipments to city. Owl + Macaw will concede, Raven oppose, Vulture undecided (until what?). Zora may arrange a jailbreak. 
	- Council is deliberating if she killed Gyrfalcon
	- Zora will want the transponder if she can get it, salvage the ship
- Sabra
	- her dad opposing her being less sheltered (sucks).
	- perhaps help save the party if they do get arrested
- rookery theft, feather scouts > orin's house (strikers, monster) > sniper > reservoir (la centra?)> final 

## Upcoming

Unmasking Gyrfalcon
- Expose identity and home address
- magic missile / sniper wound within Orin's mouth
- electrocution burns on body don't entirely match automata attacks (was a spell instead)
- leads: reservoirs (from house), 
- corinsson ambush - bridge or cliffside (let them choose?)
Gandras' Secrets
- Chance to faceoff w Gandras in the end
- reward if success: treasure, info abt gandras' corruption, 
	- long term info? kingfisher problem.  reward that ties into mainline
- if espionage fails
	- chase scene ([complications](https://5e.tools/tables.html#urban%20chase%20complications_dmg), roll each round for how many guard appear)
	- pretty limited places to hide from the law, unless they leave the isle
	- captured - owl helps them if they go after kingfisher/raven? (look for missing exam scrolls), kingfisher makes a deal to expose Macaw (for a greater reward?)
Break into rookery
- Get disguises from the guards, an access key
Kingfisher Sidequest
- Unmask Macaw. She believes he's corrupt, wants to usurp him to insert her own choice
	- Macaw/Gandras links: letters in rookery office, tax breaks, 
- Gandras Dol might take the PCs help to stop vandalism
- interview him: Macaw's governmental duties, political opinions
- try to tail him (saltwood groves, rookery), go to home or rookery office
- if they majorly damage Gandras his faction/Giltstern can come after them
- if Kingfisher gets the info: she doesn't need a new opening bc one already exists. She wants Macaw in her pocket for choosing Myla. 
- if it's exposed to the world: Gandras is ousted. Maybe loses his saltwood to Eledeia/Court, workers will definitely want him gone. Kingfisher may vouch for him to preserve appearances. Giltstern will ditch him, pivot to Kingfisher. 
Vulture Sidequest?
- Raven has dirt on him, if they can get her support
- Vulture would like to weaken Kingfisher - too chummy with the Kevarans
- coriolis? leads?
Raven starts tailing the PCs out of suspicion
- encounter against some of Raven's agents. Or Zora somehow tries to fuck them over, put them on the wrong trail? lead to an ambush
- Zora plants a tracker on one of the PCs
- Zora investigating a mystery for Titus: he purchased a nice ring off of Kareem a few years back and it's missing
	- Bronze ring of braided metal - 4 stranded braid pattern
	- Titus noticed it missing when they checked him out of questioning at the Rookery
	- Titus thinks his ex wife Ella took it off him to pawn for child support
	- Zora thinks the new adventurers in town might have stolen it, since adventurers are treasure hungry
	- Zora knows the ring is magic from Kareem, a little worried
- leads: kites
	- either Raven trusts them and tells them Merriwink is up to something weird, or Zora says she's investigating sth for Myla?
Danger in the Reservoirs
- gyrfalcon was investigating this - had questions around reduced security at cistern entrances, their soldiers were called back without their order
- tensorat helped engineer a lot of the reservoirs to ...?
The Artificer's workshop
- Tensorat was known to be active in Avizallo until 90 yrs ago - is believed that he disappeared into the caverns 
- do a dungeon crawl thru the caverns to reach the vacated lab
	- proper traps/environmental challenge where we roll initiative 
- plant clues
	- the code - "None will find it except in the shadow of the wind"
	- presence of air djinni/teleportation
- more clues leading to Owl
- [lab dungeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aqm7xo/dungeon_tinkerfitz_labs/)
The Kite Fighters
- there will be a tournament in a few days time, where Valespinner will by flying
- wining valespinner also gives an advantage to tensorat's labs? passphrases?
Get access to Giltstern's data - infiltrate or fight


each quest should give clear leads on what to do next, don't just let things happen to the pcs

Ratcheting the tension
- PCs are staying w Gandras, so these will be against them: saltwood workers, Gyrfalcon, Kingfisher, Myla
	- Kingfisher might still use them if she determines they don't actually care abt Gandras
- more fray attacks, possibly an actual fray tide
- more reservoirs getting taken out, whenever there's the chance
- more conflict at the docks, with the saltwood growers
- assassin starts hunting them, once they get to high enough prominence (figure out Orin's means of death)
- anyone they offend will come after them
- war - attack on conviviant, giltstern stops imports + calls in navy, kevaran blockade, 
	- show threat of war - ppl protesting/throwing stuff at the conviviant. subset of the military prepping themselves. Vulture campaigning. Giltstern threatens retaliation if the deal doesn't go thru
Potential encounters:
- ambush from raven (in the elevator?)
- get gandras' accounting - infiltrate the vaults
- against the feather scouts/mettlewise
- against the assassin - if they find the cove, morgana saire
- combat encounter to get into hidden cove - automata and fray wraiths
	- stop the automata from pulling out and activating wraiths
- the boss battle - happen at the precipice of war
- urban chase, staircases
- rope bridge battle where the bridge is in danger of getting cut
	- assassin firing arrows to cut the rope? other enemies coming from both sides?
- precipice of a narrow column where ppl could get knocked off
- within the cisterns, water is rising with the tide





# Treasure
- Loot dropped by owl
	- Ring of mind shielding: a bronzework ring made of intricate woven wires, small green stones set at intervals. The weaving actually makes up magic runes, recognized by Gyrfalcon.
- Loot dropped by assassin
	- crossbow
- gifts from npcs
- [Portable Hole](https://5e.tools/items.html#portable%20hole_dmg): A circular sheet of fine black cloth, 6ft in diameter. Use an action to unfold it against a solid surface, whereupon it creates an extradimensional hole 10ft deep. You can use an action to fold up the hole. Any creatures or objects remain inside the extradimensional space. The folded cloth weighs next to nothing. 

# Scratchpad

- Write down notes as things progress during the game.
