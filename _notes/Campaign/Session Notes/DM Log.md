  

- 22.11.6 - Mazfroth's Mysteries, the smuggling trip
    - motivation for taking the smuggling quest was iffy
    - getting better at char voices, at least for silly faux-erudite affected voices
    - dialogue for enemy NPCs can be better - they should have some quirks
    - maintaining voice differentiation between NPCs continues to be a struggle
    - they said they liked the chase mechanics, but I had trouble keeping track of all the steps
    - PCs did not take advantage of environment / take creative actions as much as I wanted (though they did go for the goats)
        - I did not have NPCs use environment as much either
    - balancing and bookeeping HP was an issue - treating the kobolds as a semi swarm was tough
    - heavy hitters (sleep, killing the goats) hindered the enemies from taking as many actions
    - no payoff for creative choices on part of the players (their disguise as circus players)
    - write up a bulleted game log of what happened
- 22.11.13 - Mazfroth, Velouche battle
    - denouement was scrambled, didn't resolve narrative threads clearly or with enough weight
        - you're still bad at character dialogue
        - put off by the fact that they tried to make away with all the money
    - players are extremely gold focused - need to be careful about when you offer money, or build in motivations that are not money
    - Velouche's voice did not come off as you practiced
    - it's kind of boring to do a battle where parts are gatekeeped by ability checks - having to keep trying to climb the wall is annoying, slow
    - gave them a talk to try and convince them to do more character work, RP
        - players are currently mainly interested in fucking around and doing jokes
    - more exposition from mid battle enemy dialogue
- 23.1.21 - drunk dnd (The Blind Dragonet)
    - Overall quite good!
    - Players surprisingly liked the dice game, got competitive
        - Getting table to roleplay goblins got a lot of laughs
    - Players like making friends with animals, as usual - found Tootsie v cute
    - Entirely skipped the draco rat fight via speak with animals
        - Kallista’s persuasion/deception is getting very high - going to have to limit uses, create situations with higher DCs
    - Could have more effectively pushed the mystery of “who is Vonnegut” to get players to investigate more
    - Lost Evelyn’s shitty scottish accent halfway thru
    - Could continue to be better at managing multiple ppl trying to do diff things
    - Battles can be a slog
        - too few enemies (actions) > need to up the hp > battles take a long ass time
        - Use a map?
- 23.3.20 - Strigoia Heist pt 1
    - Theodore’s accent fell apart immediately - still need to rehearse
    - Control both timbre and accent
    - felt like a little bit too much expose at the start
    - Not all players got to do cool stuff - it’s easier for the face (K) and sneaky (T)
- 23.4.5 - Strigoia Heist pt 2
    - Generally kind of bad, boring
    - timing fell apart - got thru the prep scenes but didnt manage to have them form the actual plan. Not sure how we’ll handle next session
    - Improv was still quite bad, compounded by the fact that the players are not confident at dialogue either
    - They thought Shrewseer’s overdramatic personality was funny
    - Fell flat on playing Vasilev, on populating the world with interesting details
    - Succession of different scenes didn’t feel… very interesting? Seemed like the players were continually running up against walls, not having much fun. Too many scenarios with difficult, open ended challenges
        - Give them something easy, hack and slash next?
- 23.4.14 - Strigoia Heist pt 3
    - Kallista got onboarded to servants (hints of Ornsgrym coming onto Sadie), the others come in as performers (get assigned chaperone Wally, did performance, Eletha got servants clothes from Kallista)
    - Tentatively better than last time?
    - Players enjoy dicking around as always (coming up with costumes, etc)
    - need to get better at improvising results to failures - fail forward, mixed failures, mixed success
    - little bit too much screen time for Kallista?
    - challenges they’re going thru for the heist still seem kind of ill defined
    - Figure out a way to keep up the mood, tension of a heist
- 23.4.29 - Strigoia Heist pt 4
    - Eletha confronted by Leanna, Kallista+Lumdas knock out Ornsgrym and get the treasure, Theodore dies, mythal activates
    - Still not enough sense of tension, drama, stakes
        - Most exciting part - when they knock out Ornsgrym. Player choice, breaking the rules
    - Still not great at dialogue, giving characters unique personalities + voices, clumsy at descriptions
    - Should have asked how players were feeling, Eletha esp
    - Toby + Bluemoon didn’t really get to do cool things
    - Overall PC actions haven’t really driven plot movement - you plan events (Theodore death, mythal) and the PCs get pulled along
        - Allow them to make more significant choices
        - Should I have let them negotiate with the strigoi?
- 23.9.18 - Strigoia Heist pt 5
    - Fight was kind of anticlimactic - should not have penned in strigoi w ally NPCs
        - could have broken out the dread knights earlier
        - could have pushed harder on NPCs hunting down the culprits
        - could have pushed harder on secondary battle goals (taking down mythal)
    - Railroaded the PCs into working w Vasilev - they could have tried to trick her abt leaving the painting at mansion
    - Could have had Vasilev just fight them + almost kill someone to extort others - instead of having long circuitous discussion
    - Hard to maintain multiple diff chara voices
- 23.10.8 - Bridgetown Brawl pt1
    - Street battle went on for way too long for something that’s supposed to be an intro
        - Map layout - way too big, takes rounds just to engage
        - Naming of enemies between owlbear + harmlesskey needs to be consistent
    - Confounded by fact that PCs were not particularly motivated to go fight
        - Should give them a faster out next time
    - Initial characterization of Luca was bad - not likeable enough
        - came on too heavy on how he only cares about making money, lack of ethics
        - we can salvage by having him return later in adventure, worried abt missing misurium
- 23.10.29 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 2
	- characterization for most NPCs was pretty uninteresting (Ersatz, Sophia, Basta) - seems like you need to think abt them more ahead of time
		- Ersatz is too dumb / lackadaisical, they should have some cunning - we can salvage this as them showing a front. Gotta give them a cool moment later
	- is hard to maintain distinct char voices
	- Bridgetown investigation phase was pretty uninteresting because you didn't have that much planned in depth - because the answer was never in Bridgetown
		- chars didn't have much to say
	- NPCs should ask questions to PCs, have one on one convos for character development
	- they liked the descriptive prose bits
- 23.11.5 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 3
	- Finished fighting merrow, went to tavern and met Clockwork + Merriwink. Toby wants to apprentice under Merriwink or sth. Kallista has fully disguised herself to avoid notice from clockwork. They might want to try and bait the thief with false information. 
	- They thought Ezra's real motivation was extremely funny
	- The thinness of the "investigation" phase shows through - very little info gotten from interrogation
	- Merrow battle was WAY too unbalanced, too difficult, had to cut everyone's HP
- 24.1.21 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 4
	- skill challenge - need to look up the rules for how to actually do this
		- figure out appropriate DCs based on level - I think you should have made them 15
		- Did have some cool/exciting moments - Justine thinking to swing the rope to vault over the net
			- have to get better at dramatic narration
	- the shipwreck "dungeon" was kind of a drag - most rooms were pointless
	- gotta refresh on character voices before the session - you forgot both Sophie + Vasilev
	- description of the fray coming in was not sufficiently dramatic
	- information exposition is unclear - you gotta go into a scene knowing what info the players need to be told
	- clockwork characterization not wacky enough
- 24.1.28 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 5
	- honestly rly good - battle was challenging, the secondary objective (catch mushika) was exciting, toby pulled cool stunts
	- initial surprise round thing w kallista was not the most thought out
	- PCs rly enjoyed getting to recruit mushika
	- gotta get better at cool dialogue during fights
	- stop making your character voices so high pitched and grating
- 24.2.4 - Wrath of the Butcher Balladeer pt 1
	- sloppy overall
	- went far too long on downtime - preplanned scenes need to happen first, don't let the PCs just muck around with animals for too long or you get fatigue
	- interrogation around Elysian Fog was messy - they just don't ask the questions you expect them to, so you dont have answers?
		- how could you have done this better.
	- assassination was messy! figure out the dramatic beats and handle it better
		- just dont play when you're tired
	- better exposition flashing back to / explaining the mission objectives from the hot start
- 24.2.25 - Wrath of the Butcher Balladeer pt 2
	- players rly enjoyed Clockwork's performance
	- momentum unclear - because goals unclear?
		- you gave them a lead to find Ornsgrym but it doesn't seem like anyone rly made an effort ? was it unclear? should have more clearly shown where Ornsgrym is?
		- bc they weren't bent on finding Ornsgrym, skipped the main challenge of the festival (finding Stevian)
		- seemed like there were a lot of stretches where players did nothing, you just yanked them to the next thing
	- should have let the players pick which section of the fair they went to first, then just put the other section after it
	- performance as Bagcrust was shoddy
- 24.3.3 - Wrath of the Butcher Balladeer pt 3
	- gotta get better at dialogue during battles - forgot to have all the cultists speak
	- felt bad leaving Toby out of a whole major battle - maybe should have ordered events diff?
- 24.4.21 - Wrath of the Butcher Balladeer pt 4
	- Too railroady - players were trying to find multiple catacombs, go under ass play
		- also relates to the problem if poor information telegraphing
	- Not enough information signalling, failed to establish key lore/mystery elements
		- Players were uninterested in exploring the archaelogical society - why? even though I explicitly called out a magic circle? there was no clear promise of a reward
		- Could have established finding out about the cult as a specific goal - either have the cult directly threaten PCs or have Vasilev call in a job
	- Should have had an assassin target them when they took the long rest! To remind them about the assassinations
		- you got too much in a hurry to get back on track with the dungeon
- 24.7.22 - Murder in Avizallo pt 1
	- Players seem to struggle with open world - is it bc no clear established objective?
		- this will be interesting to cross test with another group
	- Far too much exposition, narration yanking players to one place then another
	- Travel section was kinda pointless. Sahuagin battle exists to establish sahuagin but feels pointless in the moment. 
		- Could have been fixed by putting some subgoal / miniquest within the travel - whether related to main adventure or not
	- Get better at gravelly voices. Get more vivid NPCs
	- Still need to be better at improv. M tried to engage w the source and ask for a divination - you couldn't make up anything useful on the spot. It would have been fine to give away more info. 
	- Forgot to remind Pablo abt backstory, so a lot of that fell thru
	- Players still seem slow/clumsy during battle. Have to know their character sheets better. Bring this up with them?
- 24.10.6 - Murder in Avizallo pt 3
	- pacing!! this session was boring af, no tension or conflict
		- every session should have some moment of drama. this time they just went a bunch of different places, did exposition, asked questions, spun in circles
		- could have inserted a fight / serious roleplay conflict to gate off the scene of crime
		- og plan was for the Gandras infiltration to be main conflict but they didn't do that
	- idk the council session was very aggressive exposition
	- seagull interview was great, some comedy. Mushika also not bad
- 24.10.18 - Murder in Avizallo pt 4
	- ??
- 24.11.10 - MiA 5
	- Big battle at eledeia estate was poorly thought out, too many combatants. Should have just done pure roleplay, no initiative
- 24.12.8 - MiA 6
	- directionless, uninteresting. poor pacing
	- PCs directed between diff NPC conversations, problems:
		- no real stakes in any of them
		- failed to characterize Zora that well
		- NPCs didn't actually important info/quests to give
	- Bluemoon/Krystin convo - failed to hit emotional stakes
		- Neither person talked about their /feelings/ all that much
		- shouldve had Krystin bring up Bluemoon's father, dammit. didn't review your plans enough, have an idea for how the interaction was gonna go
	- have not done a great job showing the political inequities. They've been trapped on the side of Gandras/rich ppl
		- shouldve had giltstern company stores all over the island or something
	- if you do this adventure again, figure out some way to make it clear that the murderer is one of the councillors
- 24.12.15 - MiA 7 
	- idk, its definitely going on for too long
	- dynamic systems. who knew they would trust Owl that much
- 24.12.22 - Synchordance 1
	- actual player roleplay is nice. also taking notes, tracking their own statuses
	- fumbled a bit when they did things out of order but seemed like it turned out ok in the end
- 24.12.23 - Synchordance 2
	- mystery reveal stuff was kinda confusing
	- should have done an epilogue with quick scenes for everyone
- 25.1.12 - MiA 8
	- idkkk losing steam
