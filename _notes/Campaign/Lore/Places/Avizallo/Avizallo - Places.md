Restricted area

	- [x] holds all the old exam scrolls, including gyrfalcon's (recently flipped thru. cramped handwriting)
	- [x] correspondence to Giltstern: I would appreciate you (and other traders) limiting the number of Felichian missionaries you charter to the Isle. I understand your flagship has a company of 250 sailors that require a stone's worth of libations per day, but work that takes them inland can be as easily handled by those automata you've purchased. I would hope you could order these changes by ruler's desire.

	- [ ] correspondence to Giltstern:  I'll warn you again to keep your hired muscle off of the columns; and for that matter, they shouldn't be on civilian-use docks either. I will be at the picket line starting tomorrow morning. Don't think of trying anything. 
	- [ ] recent guard schedule was shifted around the reservoirs so that there were gaps - orders given to diff units under the guise of gyrfalcon's words. Gyrfalcon fixed it but wasn't sure how the orders got mixed up
	- [ ] Asked Raven for records on past Fray tides - the only historical fray attack where a tide (fog) did not also roll in was the attack that killed Vapor

If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack or a melee spell attack, you can use the power of the sandals to unleash a crashing wave. The target takes an additional 3d6 bludgeoning damage, is pushed back 15 ft, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, your choice) or be knocked prone. Creatures that are Huge or larger do not get pushed but can be knocked prone. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after a short or long rest.

	- Feline Stick: This stick feels furry despite having no hair. When the stick is stroked, it emanates a soft purring noise. Occasionally, a creature which touches this stick has the urge to somehow feed it fresh fish. Or feed it a Fish Stick.
	- Stick of Good Boys: When a well-behaved dog sees this stick, it canâ€™t help but want to play fetch with it. Unfortunately, the stick compels dogs to play with it until they collapse from exhaustion, and dogs will get grumpy if people stop throwing the stick or if they take it away.
	- Chocolate Stick: This stick is flavored like chocolate.
	- Stick of Being Different Colors: Any creature which sees this stick must succeed a DC 10 Wisdom Saving Throw or believe this stick is a random color.
