Hello, I am interested in this rental and was wondering if it is still available. Thanks!

What they know
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zmKxHYzHRuuggveMDHJoaBLHIsPC0edeLqac3HGUse4/edit?usp=sharing
- there was an air genasi working in the guard some years ago 
- la sul reservoir is broken
- automata were acting on remote orders but are not giltstern owned - broken crystal to match with signature
- gandras was late to the riot scene (was playing Macaw at first)
- gyrfalcon's body was brought there in a crate (branded Kingswill)
- the automata left the riot in a crate - went to hidden cove with automata, saw skulls
- Kingswill joined trading council, registered to Morgana Saire
What they need to know
- wraiths are being created from skulls/sahuagin
	- Vapor's death
- Kingswill - Giltstern connection, black diamond imports, Featherweight, sahuagin culling
- Gyrfalcon's actual means of death
- Gyrfalcon's identity, home - implies that killer knew their identity
- Owl knowing Gyrfalcon's identity via letters, exams
- Corinsson
- Reservoirs
What others know
- Owl
	- they have figured out the automata were not giltstern. She's already disadvantaged at hoodwinking them, but can maybe turn it around and make them think Eledeia is working for Giltstern
	- they have discovered the cave, skulls, automata carrying them there. Could still be pinned on Eledeia
	- all the automata are out of commission, Owl can no longer command using the transponder
	- prompt the PCs to find a motive for Kingfisher killing gyrfalcon 
		- trying to install Myla as successor
		- secretly in league w Giltstern? what evidence is there that Kingfisher was actually going to use the ship to benefit Avizallo? she could have cut a deal to directly sell ships to Giltstern
	- can she turn Gandras/sabra against the players?
- Eledeia
	- arrested. sent Zora to cover up loose ends?
- Remaining councillors: Owl, Vulture are both pro-war. Raven is mildly against
	- Owl will try to spin the reservoir attacks as being Giltstern, trying to threaten Avizallo over Eledeia
- Kind of obvious (based on their questions at the council) that they're not from here
Roleplay thrulines
- Bluemoon and his dad - works best if B has some failure and is compared to his dad. Anyone who talks shit abt his dad?
	- Kristyn says Vapor was a fool
- Toby and Sabra - mission getting between him and Sabra. Sabra finding out the truth. 
	- Sabra character arc: becoming less sheltered? 
- Bluemoon and Kristyn Eledeia
Restructure the endgame?
- coriolis, tensorat. big bad?
- remove the stuff abt Gilead. Owl wants Tensorat's secrets for herself (what secrets?). Doesn't care about the war.
